# OBJECTIVE

  * To design an automatic seat heater system which is smart enough to heat the seat when so ever is needed.
  * To conserve the energy by making the system operate at needed times.
 
# Introduction
  
  * Automatic Seat Heater System transfers heat directly to the user rather than warming up the interior of the automobiles like car.
  * Because of this, these seats can actually conserve energy (and gas).
  * Moreover,the user you might not need the heater on at all times.
  * This system is intelligent enough that is has the ability to make the heater ON and OFF as per the requirement.
